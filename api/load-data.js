        'First and foremost, our goal with Nerd Fitness is to remove EVERY barrier that keep people like you from changing your life for the better. After struggling to get myself healthy for many years and FINALLY finding some success, I knew I wanted to start helping others like me.I was so sick of infomercials selling useless fitness products, marketers selling dangerous supplements, and people getting discouraged when they didnâ€™t get results from these things. These products are designed to make money for big conglomerates or internet marketers, not to actually help people live better. And based on how elaborate the schemes are to get people to buy their stuff, these companies are making a lot of money. So I set out to change that. In 2008, I purchased the domain NerdFitness.com because I didnâ€™t see anybody helping out people like me: people with desk jobs that love nerd culture, games, books, and movies, but also know they need to make healthier choices in their day to day lives.',
